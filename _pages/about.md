Hi! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Jose H. Blanchet](https://joseblanchet.com/). In the academic year 2025--2026, my research is generously supported by a Jump Trading Fellowship.

 I am broadly interested in probability theory and its applications. My recent interest lies in branching particle systems (or more general log-correlated fields) and their applications in polymer physics and mathematical biology. I also work on optimal transport and applications to statistics, economics, and operations research. Other topics I have been actively working on include decision trees and Gaussian processes.

Before, I received my bachelor’s degree in Pure Mathematics from University of Waterloo, where I was fortunate to work with Profs. [Alexander Schied](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/aschied), [Yi Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/), and [Ruodu Wang](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/).
